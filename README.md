A C++ application for reading .off files and visualizing using Qt.

# Motivation

This repository's objective is to implement the article **"Interactive Graphics Applications with OpenGL Shading Language and Qt"** for an assignment in our Computer Graphics class in college. We decided to make this repository public, so people can see the steps we took to implement using the current version of Qt, since the article is from 2012, and we are making this project in 2021 :-) .

- [x] Create Qt interface
